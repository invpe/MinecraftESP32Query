# MinecraftESP32Query
A simple query implementation to obtain basic stats of the MC server.
The sketch will return :

```
15:14:52.091 -> MOTD: Curse of a large block GameType: SMP Map: world Players: 0
```

Which is enough to create a nice 3d printed block, with an LED inside that tells if anyone is playing on the server now.
have PHun!
